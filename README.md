mvn is a popular build automation and dependency management tool primarily used for Java based projects.
It is a commonly used CLI tool to run the test automation suites for java projects.

Here are few commonly used commands.

**mvn validate** - ensure that the project is properly configured and structured before proceeding with other Maven goals like compilation, testing, packaging, etc. It's often used as a preliminary step in the build process to catch any potential issues early on.

**mvn clean** - clean up the project before a fresh build.

**mvn compile** - compiles the source code of the project. It checks for errors in the code and generates the bytecode.

**mvn test** - runs the unit tests in the project. It executes any test cases written by the developers to ensure that the code behaves as expected.

**mvn package** - packages the compiled code and resources into a distributable format, such as a JAR (Java ARchive) file, WAR (Web ARchive) file, or EAR (Enterprise ARchive) file.

**mvn install** - installs the packaged artifact into the local Maven repository. Other projects on the same machine can then use this artifact as a dependency.

**mvn deploy** - deploys the packaged artifact to a remote repository, such as Nexus or Artifactory, making it accessible to other developers or projects.
